Credit Card Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing credit card data to derive valuable insights and answer key business questions. Using Python and SQL, I cleaned the dataset, explored it thoroughly, and provided answers to potential questions that a business leader might ask. The dataset was downloaded from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/computingvictor/transactions-fraud-datasets/data), and it includes information such as card brands, card types, expiry dates, credit limits, and security indicators like whether a card is flagged on the dark web.

In Python, I started by cleaning the dataâ€”removing duplicates, handling null values, and addressing outliers to ensure data consistency. After that, I analyzed the data to answer important questions, such as:
- What is the average credit limit across all clients?
- How many cards are flagged as appearing on the dark web?
- What is the distribution of card types (Credit/Debit)? Using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I created visualizations to better understand these trends.

   Similarly, I used SQL to dive deeper into the data. SQL queries allowed me to calculate metrics, extract detailed insights, and create a structured view of the dataset. For example, I analyzed the number of cards issued per client, identified high-risk cards based on their flags, and explored trends like the frequency of PIN updates over time.

By anticipating potential business-related questions, I ensured the analysis addressed real-world concerns, such as assessing risk (card_on_dark_web), evaluating client activity, and understanding card expiration trends. The results of this analysis were documented, visualized, and made easy to interpret.
